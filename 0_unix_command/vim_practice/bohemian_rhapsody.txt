     1	Is this the real life?
     2	Is this just fantasy?
     3	Caught in a landside,
     4	No escape from reality
     5	Open your eyes,
     6	Look up to the skies and see,
     7	I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
     8	Because I'm easy come, easy go,
     9	Little high, little low,
    10	Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
    11	Me, to me
    12	Mamaaa,
    13	Just killed a man,
    14	Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
    15	Now he's dead
    16	Mamaaa, life had just begun,
    17	But now I've gone and thrown it all away
    18	Mama, oooh,
    19	Didn't mean to make you cry,
    20	If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
    21	Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
    22	Too late, my time has come,
    23	Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
    24	The time
    25	Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
    26	Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
    27	Mama, oooh
    28	I don't want to die,
    29	I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
    30	I see a little silhouetto of a man,
    31	Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
    32	Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
    33	Galileo, Galileo
    34	Galileo, Galileo
    38	Spare him his life from this monstrosity
    35	Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
    36	I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
    37	He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
    38	Spare him his life from this monstrosity
    39	Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
    40	Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
    41	(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    42	(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
    43	(Let me go) Will not let you go
    44	(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
    45	(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
    46	No, no, no, no, no, no, no
    47	Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
    48	Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
    49	For meee
    50	So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
    51	So you think you can love me and leave me to die
    52	Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
    53	Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
    54	Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
    55	Nothing really matters,
    56	Nothing really matters to me
    57	Any way the wind blows...
